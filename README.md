## ioBroker adapter for Zigbee devices via TI cc2531/cc2530/cc26x2r/cc2538 and deCONZ ConBee/RaspBee.

With the Zigbee-coordinator based on Texas Instruments SoC cc253x (and others models) or deCONZ ConBee/RaspBee modules, it creates its own zigbee-network, into which zigbee-devices are connected. By work directly with the coordinator, the driver allows you to manage devices without additional application / gateways / bridge from device manufacturers (Xiaomi / TRADFRI / Hue / Tuya). About the device Zigbee-network can be read [here (in English)](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/zigbee_network.html).

## Hardware

### Texas Instruments SoC
..
For work, you need one of the following Adapters [all are listed here](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/supported_adapters.html) , flashed with a special ZNP firmware: [cc2531, cc2530, cc26x2r, cc2538](https://github.com/Koenkk/Z-Stack-firmware)

## Work with adapter

![](docs/tutorial/zigbee.png)

To start the driver, you must specify the name of the port on which the Zigbee-module (stick) is connected. Usually this is the port `/dev/ttyACM0` or `/dev/ttyUSB0` for the UART-connection. Or you can find with `ls -l /dev/serial/by-id` the device direct.

open the settings and change port
![](docs/tutorial/settings.png)


For Windows this will be the COM port number.

Starting from version 1.0.0 you can also use *tcp connection* for cases using esp8266 (or other microcontrollers) as serial-bridge. For example `tcp://192.168.1.46:8880`. Read more info here https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/connecting_cc2530#via-an-esp8266

To connect devices, you need to switch the Zigbee-coordinator to pairing mode by pressing the green button. The countdown will begin (60 seconds) until the device connectivity is available.
To connect Zigbee devices in most cases, just press the pairing button on the device itself. But there are features for some devices. More information about pairing with devices can be found [here (in English)](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/getting_started/pairing_devices.html)

After successful pairing, the device appears in the configuration panel. If the device appears in the configuration panel but has the type "undefined", then this is an unknown device and can not be work with it. If the device is in the list of available devices, but added as "undefined", then try to remove the device and add it again.

The devices connected to the Zigbee-network and inform the coordinator of their status and events (button presses, motion detection, temperature change). This information is reflected in the ioBroker object-states. Some ioBroker states have feedback and send commands to the zigbee-device when the value changes (switching the state of the outlet or lamp, changing the scene or the brightness of the lamp).

### Device Groups
You may create groups of devices.

![](docs/tutorial/groups-1.png)

It is a Zigbee feature, intended for example to switch bulbs synchronized. Assign groups via device tabs edit button. A group will show as own "device" in Objects.

![](docs/tutorial/groups-2.png)

Note: Not all devices support groups (not supported by end devices like sensors).


### Binding

https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/binding

### Developer Tab

This is a tool for advanced users to test currently unsupported devices or enhance this adapters functionality. More instructions can be found on tab.
![](docs/tutorial/tab-dev-1.png)

## Additional info

There is a [friendly project](https://github.com/koenkk/zigbee2mqtt) with similar functionality on the same technologies, where you can work with the same devices using the MQTT protocol. Therefore, if any improvements or support for new zigbee-devices occur in the Zigbee2MQTT project, we can transfer and add the same functionality to this adapter. If you notice this, then write the issue - we'll postpone it.

There are knowledge bases that can be useful for working with Zigbee-devices and equipment:
* in English https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/
* in Russian https://myzigbee.ru/

## Changelog

### 1.6.0 (2021-08-09)
Attention!

After introducing a new z-stack startup procedure into zigbee-herdsman, we got some problems with our adapter in version 1.5.6.
This was discussed [here](https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.zigbee/issues/1110) and [here](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee-herdsman/issues/376)

Unfortunately, not all user sticks were able to work successfully with this new init routine. This mainly affected the TI cc2538 based sticks with the 2019 year's firmware. All subsequent firmwares and sticks have no problems when starting the adapter or they can be fixed.

At the moment, there is no working solution to this problem, except for updating the firmware of such sticks to a newer one.
As a fallback, it is proposed to use the old version of zigbee-herdsman 0.13.93, but some of the devices and functionality may not work.
Therefore, we made a separate version 1.6.0o especially for this case. It can be installed from github at https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.zigbee/tarball/old_herdsman

* (asgothian) Hue_calibration for exposed devices (Use requires PR on zigbee-herdsman-converters, PR is being worked on)
* (asgothian) fix Tuya Thermostat: restore lost property "preset"
* (asgothian) Change for Device Availability: Stagger initial ping by 200 ms to prevent network congestion due to a large number of ping requests
* (asgothian) Change for Device Availability: Ping request triggered on reconnect. Before the herdsman Ping function is used, the adapter attempts to read the "state" dp. If this is successful, no ping is sent and the state is set
* (asgothian) Change for Device Availability: Set link Quality to 0 when a device is not connected, 10 when it is reconnecting.
* (asgothian) fix for message "illegal properties x,y" - remove color and color_temp from readable states on device available again (Issue #607)
* (asgothian) RGB Color can now be entered as "named" color. Implemented names are taken from the list of extended web colors on wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors)
* (asgothian) change in how RGB color is parsed. Incomplete colors will now be parsed successfully. #FFF will result in R 0, G 15, B 255
* (asgothian) change in OTA: Message that a device does not respond for OTA query downgraded to "info" from "error"
* (asgothian) new coordinator card


### 1.4.0 (2020-12)
* Many new devices available

Starting from version 1.4.0, new devices in iobroker.zigbee will be added automatically, based on the *exposes* described in zigbee-herdsman-converters.
The *exposes* section describes the device's capabilities, events and control commands. In iobroker.zigbee these descriptions are converted to iobroker states.
This means that the new device is described correctly enough in zigbee-herdsman-converters to start working with iobroker.zigbee (do not need to add it to our /lib/devices files.js and /lib/states.js).

The only thing that is not described (yet, it may change in the future) in zigbee-herdsman-converters is the device image. This is why the device icon on network map uses external links to the resource https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/images/devices/*.
If you want to use local images, then you need to put the image file in /admin/img and briefly describe the device in the /lib/devices.js file without the *states*:
```
{
    models: [‘01MINIZB’],
    icon: 'img/ITEAD01ZBMINI. png',
}
```
in this case, the *states* attribute will be formed based on the *exposes* description and the image will be local.
