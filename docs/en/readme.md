# ioBroker adapter for working with Zigbee-devices
With the Zigbee-coordinator based on Texas Instruments SoC cc253x (and others), it creates its own zigbee-network, into which zigbee-devices are connected. By work directly with the coordinator, the driver allows you to manage devices without additional gateways / bridge from device manufacturers (Xiaomi / TRADFRI / Hue). About the device Zigbee-network can be read [here (in English)](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/wiki/ZigBee-network).

## Hardware
For work, you need one of the following devices, flashed with a special ZNP firmware: [cc2531, cc2530, cc2530 + RF](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/wiki/Supported-sniffer-devices#zigbee-coordinator)

The necessary equipment for the firmware and the device preparation process is described [here (in English)](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/wiki/Getting-started) or [here (in Russian)](https://github.com/kirovilya/ioBroker.zigbee/wiki/%D0%9F%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%88%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%B0)

The devices connected to the Zigbee-network inform the coordinator of their status and events (button presses, motion detection, temperature change). This information is reflected in the ioBroker object-states. Some ioBroker states have feedback and send commands to the zigbee-device when the value changes (switching the state of the outlet or lamp, changing the scene or the brightness of the lamp).

## Work with adapter
To start the driver, you must specify the name of the port on which the cc253x device is connected.

To connect devices, you need to switch the Zigbee-coordinator to pairing mode by pressing the green button. The countdown will begin (60 seconds) until the device connectivity is available.
To connect Zigbee devices in most cases, just press the pairing button on the device itself. But there are features for some devices. More information about pairing with devices can be found [here (in English)](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/wiki/Pairing-devices) or [here (in Russian)](https://github.com/kirovilya/ioBroker.zigbee/wiki#%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B6%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%B5%D0%BC%D1%8B%D0%B5-%D1%83%D1%81%D1%82%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B9%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B2%D0%B0)

After successful pairing, the device appears in the configuration panel. If the device appears in the configuration panel but has the type "undefined", then this is an unknown device and can not be work with it. If the device is in the list of available devices, but added as "undefined", then try to remove the device and add it again.

## Additional info
There is a [friendly project](https://github.com/koenkk/zigbee2mqtt) with similar functionality on the same technologies, where you can work with the same devices using the MQTT protocol. Therefore, if any improvements or support for new zigbee-devices occur in the Zigbee2MQTT project, we can transfer and add the same functionality to this adapter. If you notice this, then write the issue - we'll postpone it.

There are knowledge bases that can be useful for working with Zigbee-devices and equipment:
